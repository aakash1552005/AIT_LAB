TASK:1
Implementation of Graph search algorithms (Breadth first search and Depth First Search) using following constraints.

Aim:   To Implement of Graph search algorithms (Breadth first search and Depth
First Search) using Python.

Task 1A

Algorithm:
BFS
Step 1: Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
Step 2: Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
Step 3:  Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
Step 4:  Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.
